# Models Package

The `models` package is a collection of classes used in this project for managing various data models. It serves as a base for other classes and provides a common structure for managing the `id` attribute.

## Base Class

The `Base` class is the foundation of all classes in the `models` package. It manages the `id` attribute and provides a consistent way of assigning unique identifiers to instances.

### Usage

To use the `Base` class, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Base` class from the `models.base` module:

   ```python
   from models.base import Base
Create instances of the Base class:

python
Copy
b1 = Base()
b2 = Base()
```

Each instance will be assigned a unique `id` value.
Class Documentation
For detailed information about the Base class and its usage, refer to the class documentation. You can view the class documentation using the following command:

bash
Copy
python3 -c 'print(__import__("models.base").Base.__doc__)'
Additional Classes
This package may contain additional classes that build upon the Base class and provide specific functionalities for different data models. Refer to the documentation of each class to understand their usage and purpose.
